				<h3><li>Rocket Game</li></h3>
				<li> <img src="rocketgame.png"  Width="200" alt="Games"> </li>
				<p>This is a game I made in highschool. In my highschool we used the website code.org to code.</p>
				<p>The player has 3 lives and every asteriod destroyed is worth one point.</p>
				<p>After the player is hit 3 times by asteriods it will be game over and it will display your score.</p>
				<p>You can play the game by using the Rocket Game button down below.</button></p>
				<h3><li>login Website</li></h3>
				<li><img src="loginwebsite.png" Width="200" alt="Games"></li>
				<p>This a website I made recently that lets the user log in or register if does have an account.</p>
				<p>It does not actually let you sign up or log in this is something I am still working on.</p>
				<p>I am planning on making the website let you log in and make an account and save this information in a dtabase I make</p>
				<P>There is also a website I made in high school about my favorite things. You can see it by clicking on the High school Website button.</P>
				<p>I have made more projects like a caculator, a sort of caculator that tell you your star sign, text based game and more.</p>
				<p>They will be added on github in the future.</p>
