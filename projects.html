				<h3><li>Rocket Game</li></h3>
				<li> <img src="rocketgame.png"  Width="200" alt="Games"> </li>
				<p>This is a game I made in high school. At my high school, we used the website Code.org for coding</p>
				<p>The player has three lives, and every asteroid destroyed is worth one point.</p>
				<p>After the player is hit three times by asteroids, it will be game over, and your score will be displayed.</p>
				<p>You can play the game by clicking the "Rocket Game" button below.</button></p>
				<h3><li>login Website</li></h3>
				<li><img src="loginwebsite.png" Width="200" alt="Games"></li>
				<p>This is a website I recently made that allows the user to log in or register if they do not have an account.</p>
				<p>Currently, it does not actually let you sign up or log in, as this is something I am still working on.</p>
				<p>My plan is to make the website functional by 
					letting users log in, create an account, and save this information in a database that I will make.</p>
				<P>Additionally, I also created a website in high school about my favorite things. 
					You can access it by clicking on the "High School Website" button.</P>
				<p>I have made other projects too, such as a calculator, a star sign calculator, a text-based game, and more.</p>
				<p> I will be adding them to Github in the future.</p>
