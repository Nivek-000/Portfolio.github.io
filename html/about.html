			<h1>About Me</h1>	
            <p>Hello my full name is Kevin Chun Celis I am 20 years old and 
                I am a 3rd Year student at California Stae university(CSULA).</p>
            <p>I am majoring in computer science hoping to get a job in Machinery, 
                also a member of Association for Computing Machinery(ACM).</p>
            <p>I learned about computer science in my junior year highschool. 
                I mostly learned html, css and a bit of python. 
                I am more familiar with the Java language this is what I have been using for about 2 years.</p>
            <p>When I am not coding I like to play games with friends, read fantasy novels and play volleyball with friends.</p>
            <p>I always like to make new friends to play games with, 
                I mainly play PC but I do have an Xbox , Nintendo Switch and Playstation to play with.</p>
